# Virtware
Record/Play Virtual Sequence of Hardware Events.

## When it can be useful ?
The goal is to be able to automate human routines, such as uploading social media contents, sending a message, or even more complex routines such as   

## Target Featues
- [ ] Record and play routines (aka VHR for Virtual Hardware Routine).
- [ ] Scripting language to directly perform hardware events in a simple and straightforward manner (example: `mouse click 20 20; key press A;...`).
- [ ] Schedule routines to be played at a specific date and time.
- [ ] Create key shortcuts to launch specific saved routines.
- [ ] Use ML (like OpenCV) to make routines cognitive. 


### Terms
